All beings by nature are Buddha, \
As ice by nature is water. \
Apart from water there is no ice; \
Apart from beings, no Buddha.

How sad that people ignore the near \
And search for truth afar: \
Like someone in the midst of water \
Crying out in thirst; \
Like a child of a wealthy home \
Wandering among the poor.

Lost on dark paths of ignorance, \
We wander through the Six Worlds; \
From dark path to dark path \
When shall we be freed from birth and death?

Oh, the zazen of the Mahayana! \
To this the highest praise! \
Devotion, repentance, training, \
The many Paramitas \
All have their source in zazen.

Those who try zazen even once \
Wipe away beginningless crimes. \
Where are all the dark paths then? \
The Pure Land itself is near.

Those who hear this truth even once \
And listen with a grateful heart, \
Treasuring it, revering it, \
Gain blessings without end.

Much more, those who turn about \
And bear witness to self-nature, \
Self nature that is no-nature, \
Go far beyond mere doctrine.

Here effect and cause are the same; \
The Way is neither two nor three.

With form that is no-form, \
Going and coming we are never astray; \
With thought that is no-thought, \
Singing and dancing are the voice of the Law.

Boundless and free is the sky of Samadhi! \
Bright the full moon of wisdom! \
Truly, is anything missing now? \
Nirvāṇa is right here, before our eyes; ○ \
This very place is the Lotus Land; ○ \
This very body, the Buddha. ○ \

Fundamentally speaking, the basis of the Way is perfectly pervasive. How could it be contingent on practice and verification? The vehicle of the Ancestors is naturally unrestricted. Why should we expend sustained effort? Surely the whole being is far beyond defilement; who could believe in a method to polish it? It is never apart from this very place; what is the use of a pilgrimage to practice it? And yet, with just a hair's breadth of distinction, the gap is like that between heaven and earth. Once the slightest like or dislike arises, all is confused and the mind is lost. You should know that repeated migrations through eons of time depend on a single moment's reflection; losing your way in this world of defilement derives from your failure to stop deliberation. If you wish to transcend the extreme beyond, just directly accede to the Way.

Though you might be proud of your understanding and replete with insight, having gotten hold of the wisdom that knows at a glance, though you may have attained the Way and clarified the Mind, giving rise to the spirit that assaults the heavens, you may still be loitering near the entrance, lacking something of the vital path of liberation. Even in the case of the Buddha, innately wise though he was, we see traces of his six years of sitting erect, and in the case of Bodhidharma, though he succeeded to the Mind seal, we still hear of his famous nine years facing the wall. When even the ancient sages practiced like this, how could people today dispense with pursuing the Way? Therefore, stop your intellectual exercise of investigating words and chasing after talk; study the reverse way, turn the light and shine it back. Body and mind will drop away of themselves, and your original face will appear. If you want such an experience, exert yourselves urgently.

For studying Zen, one should have quiet quarters. Be moderate in food and drink. Cast aside all involvements and discontinue all affairs. Do not think of good or evil; do not preoccupy yourself with right or wrong. Halt the revolutions of your mind, intellect, and consciousness; stop your calculating thoughts, ideas, and perceptions. Do not try to make yourself a Buddha, much less be attached to sitting still.

In a place where you can sit regularly, spread a thick mat and place a cushion on it. Sit in either the full lotus or the half lotus position. For the full lotus, first place your right foot on your left thigh; then place your left foot on your right thigh. For the half lotus, simply rest your left foot on your right thigh.

Loosen your robe and belt, and arrange them properly. Next, place your right hand on your left foot, and your left on your right palm. Touch the tips of your thumbs together. Then straighten your body and sit erect. Do not lean to the left or right, backward or forward. Your ears should be in line with your shoulders, and your nose in line with your navel. Touch your tongue against the front of your palate and close your lips and teeth. Your eyes should always remain open. Breathe gently through your nose.

Once you have regulated your posture, take a breath and exhale fully. Swing to the left and right. Sitting fixedly, think without thoughts. How do you think without thoughts? Nonthinking. This is the essential art of zazen. Zazen is not the practice of dhyana: it is simply the Dharma gate of ease and joy. It is the practice and verification of ultimate bodhi. The genjo koan—baskets and cages cannot capture it!

If you grasp the point of this practice, the four elements of your body will become light and easy, your spirit will be fresh and sharp, thoughts will be correct and clear; the flavor of the Dharma will sustain your spirit, and you will be calm, pure, and joyful. Your daily life will express your true natural state. Once you achieve clarification of the truth, you may be likened to a dragon entering the water or a tiger taking to the mountains. You should realize that when Right Thought is present, dullness and agitation cannot intrude. When you arise from sitting, move slowly and arise calmly; do not be hasty or undignified.

When we try zazen, we see that transcending the profane and surpassing the holy, shedding this body while seated and fleeing this while standing, are totally subject to its power. Surely, then, to grasp the turn of a chance presented by a finger, a pole, a needle or a mallet, and to present the verification of accord with a whisk, a fist, a staff or a shout—these are not to be understood through the discriminations of thinking, much less through the practice and verification of supernormal powers. They necessarily represent activity beyond sound and form; how could they fail to provide a standard before knowledge and understanding?

Therefore, it does not matter whether one is very smart or very stupid. In this practice there is no distinction between those of sharp and dull faculties. Single-minded exertion is itself pursuit of the Way. Practice and verification are by nature undefiled. Advancement to enlightenment is just an everyday affair. In our world and the other quarters, from the Western Heaven to the Eastern Earth, all equally maintain the Buddha seal, while each enjoys a particular style of teaching. As you are, therefore, devote yourself exclusively to your practice of zazen. There are ten thousand distinctions and a thousand differences, but your fundamental concern is to study Zen and pursue the Way.

Why abandon the seat in your own home to wander in vain through the dusty regions of another land? If you make one false step, you miss what is right before you. Since you already have the functioning essence of a human body, do not pass your days in vain. Maintain the integral work of the Buddha Way. Who can carelessly take pleasure at sparks from flint? Truly, form and substance are like the dew on the grass, and the fortunes of life like a flash of lightning: in an instant they are emptied, in a moment they are lost.

Eminent students of the Dharma, you are long accustomed to groping for the elephant. Please do not doubt the true dragon. Apply yourselves to the Way that points directly at reality; honor the one who is beyond learning and free of rank. Accord with the bodhi of all the Buddhas; succeed to the samadhi of all the Ancestors. If you conduct yourself as such a person for a long time, you will become such a person. Your storehouse of treasures will open of itself, and you may use them as you will.

#sutra-title("Actualizing the Fundamental Point", kanji: "現成公案", romaji: "Genjōkōan")

When all dharmas are the Buddha-dharma, there are delusion and enlightenment, practice, birth, death, buddhas, and sentient beings. When the myriad dharmas all are without self, there is no delusion, no enlightenment, no buddhas, no sentient beings, no birth, and no death. Since originally the Buddha way goes beyond abundance and scarcity, there are birth and death, delusion and enlightenment, sentient beings and buddhas.

Yet, though it is like this, simply, flowers fall amid our longing and weeds spring up amid our antipathy. Carrying the self forward to confirm [the existence of] the myriad dharmas is delusion. The myriad dharmas advancing and confirming [the existence of] the self is realization. Those who have great realization about delusion are buddhas. Those who are greatly deluded within realization are sentient beings. Further, there are people who attain realization upon realization and people who are deluded within delusion.

When Buddhas are truly buddhas they do not need to be aware of being buddhas. However, they are actualized buddhas and further actualize buddhahood. In mustering the whole body and mind and seeing forms, in mustering the whole body and mind and hearing sounds, they are intimately perceived; but it is not like the reflection in a mirror, nor like the moon in the water. When one side is realized the other side is dark.

To study the Buddha way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by the myriad dharmas. To be enlightened by the myriad dharmas is to bring about the dropping away of body and mind of both oneself and others. The traces of enlightenment come to an end, and this traceless enlightenment is continued endlessly. When one starts to search out the dharma, one separates oneself far from the dharma. When the dharma has already been rightly transmitted in oneself, just then one is immediately one’s original self.

If, when riding along in a boat, one looks around and sees the shore, one mistakenly thinks that the bank is moving. But looking directly at the boat, one discovers that it is the boat that is moving along. Likewise, with confused thoughts about body and mind, holding to discrimination of the myriad dharmas, one mistakenly thinks one’s own mind and nature are permanent. If, intimately engaged in daily activities, one returns to right here, the principle that the myriad dharmas have no clear self is clear.

Firewood becomes ash. It does not turn into firewood again. But we should not hold to the view that the ash is after and the firewood is before. Know that firewood abides in its dharma position as firewood and has its past and future. Though it has its past and future, it cuts off past and future. Ash is in its dharma position as ash and has its past and future. Just as this firewood, after it has become ash, does not turn into firewood again, so a person, after death, does not take rebirth. Therefore, we do not say that life becomes death. This is the established way of the Buddha-dharma. For this reason it is called unborn. Death does not become life. This is the established Buddha-turning of the dharma wheel. For this reason it is called undying. Life is its own time. Death is its own time. For example, it is like winter and spring. We don't think that winter becomes spring. We don't say that spring becomes summer.

A person getting enlightened is like the moon reflecting in the water. The moon does not get wet, the water is not disturbed. Though it is a great expanse of light, it reflects in a little bit of water; the whole moon and the whole sky reflect even in the dew on the grass; they reflect even in a single drop of water. Enlightenment not disturbing the person is like the moon not piercing the water. A person not obstructing enlightenment is like the dewdrop not obstructing the heavens. The depth is the measure of the height. As for the length or brevity of the time [of the reflection], one ought to examine whether the water is large or small and discern whether the sky and moon are wide or narrow.

If the dharma has not yet fully come into one's body and mind, one thinks it is already sufficient. On the other hand, if the dharma fills one's body and mind, there is a sense of insufficiency. It is like going out in a boat in the middle of an ocean with no mountains. Looking in the four directions one only sees a circle; no distinguishing forms are seen. Nevertheless, this great ocean is not a circle nor does it have directions. The wondrous features of this ocean that remain beyond our vision are inexhaustible. It is like a palace; it is like a jeweled necklace. It is just that, as far as my eye reaches for the time being, it appears to be a circle. The myriad dharmas are also just like that. Though they include all forms within and beyond the dusty world, clear seeing and understanding only reach as far as the power of our penetrating insight.

In order to understand the nature of the myriad dharmas, in addition to seeing the directions and circle, we should know that the mountains and oceans have whole worlds of innumerable wondrous features. We should understand that it is not only our distant surroundings that are like this, but even what is right here, even in a single drop of water.

When fish swim in the water, no matter how much they swim the water does not come to an end. When birds fly in the sky, no matter how much they fly, the sky does not come to an end. However, though fish and birds have never been apart from the water and the air, when the need is great the function is great; when the need is small the function is small. Likewise, it is not that at every moment they are not acting fully, not that they do not turn and move freely everywhere, but if a bird leaves the air, immediately it dies; if a fish leaves the water, immediately it dies. We should realize that because of water there is life. We should realize that because of air there is life. Because there are birds there is life; because there are fish there is life. Life is the bird and life is the fish. Besides this we could proceed further. It is just the same with practice and enlightenment and the lives of people.

So, if there were a bird or fish that wanted to go through the sky or the water only after thoroughly investigating its limits, it would not attain its way nor find its place in the water or in the sky. If one attains this place, these daily activities manifest absolute reality. If one attains this Way, these daily activities are manifest absolute reality. This Way, this place, is neither large nor small, neither self nor other, has neither existed previously nor is it just now manifesting, and thus it is just as it is. Therefore, for a person who practices and realizes the Buddha way, to attain one dharma is to penetrate one dharma; to encounter one activity is to practice one activity.

Since this is the place, and since the Way pervades everywhere, the reason that the limit of what is knowable cannot be known is that this knowledge arises and is penetrated simultaneously with the complete accomplishment of the Buddha-dharma. One should certainly not think that, attaining this place, it necessarily becomes one’s own perception, nor that it is a matter of knowledge. Even though complete realization is immediately manifest, it is not always seen as one's intimate being, and why need it be?

As Zen master Pao-ch'e of Mount Ma-ku was fanning himself, a monk came and said, “The nature of wind is permanently abiding and there is no place it does not reach. Why, master, do you still use a fan?” The master said, “You only know that the nature of wind is permanently abiding, but you do not yet know the true meaning of ‘there is no place it does not reach.’” The monk said, “What is the true meaning of ‘there is no place it does not reach’?” The master just fanned himself. The monk bowed deeply.

The true experience of the Buddha-dharma and its living way of correct transmission are like this. To say, “If the nature of wind is permanently abiding we need not use a fan; even when we don't use a fan there should still be wind,” is to know neither the meaning of permanently abiding nor the nature of wind. Because the nature of wind is permanently abiding, the wind of the house of the buddhas makes manifest the earth as pure gold and turns the long river into sweet cream.

#sutra-title("The Four Virtues of a Bodhisattva", kanji: "菩薩四攝法", romaji: "Bodaisatta Shishōbō")

#set par(first-line-indent: 1.8em, leading: 0.65em, spacing: 1.0em, justify: true)

The bodhisattva's four methods of guidance are giving, kind speech, beneficial action, and cooperation.

"Giving" means non-greed. Non-greed means not to crave. Not to crave means not to curry favor. Even if you govern the Four Continents, you should always convey the correct teaching with non-greed. It is to give away unneeded belongings to someone you don't know, to offer flowers blooming on a distant mountain to the Tathagata, or, again, to offer treasures you had in your former life to sentient beings. Whether it is of teaching or of material, in each case we are originally endowed with the virtue that accompanies giving. The question is not whether the gift is cheap or small, because its merit is still authentic.

When you leave the way to the way, you attain the way. At the time of attaining the way, the way is always left to the way. When treasure is left just as treasure, treasure becomes giving. You give yourself to yourself and others to others. The power of the causal relations of giving reaches to devas, human beings, and even enlightened sages. The reason is that in the act of giving, the one who gives and one who receives form a connection with each other.

Buddha said, "When a person who practices giving goes to an assembly, people take notice." You should know that the mind of such a person communicates subtly with others. Therefore, give even a phrase or verse of the truth; it will be a wholesome seed for this and other lifetimes. Give your valuables, even a penny or a blade of grass; it will be a wholesome root for this and other lifetimes. The truth can turn into valuables; valuables can turn into the truth. This is all because the giver is willing.

If you study giving closely, you see that to accept a body and to give up the body are both giving. Making a living and producing things can be nothing other than giving. To leave flowers to the wind, to leave birds to the seasons, are also acts of giving. Not only should you make an effort to give, but also be mindful of every opportunity to give. You are born into this present life because of the merit of giving in the past.

Buddha said, "If you are to practice giving to yourself, how much more so to your parents, partner, children, and friends." Therefore you should know that to give to yourself is a part of giving. To give to your family is also giving. Even when you give a particle of dust, you should rejoice in your own act, because you correctly transmit the merit of all buddhas, and for the first time practice an act of a bodhisattva. The mind of a sentient being is difficult to change. You should keep on changing the minds of sentient beings, from the first moment that they have one particle, to the moment that they attain the way. This should be started by giving. For this reason giving is the first of the six paramitas.

Mind is beyond measure. Things given are beyond measure. Moreover, in giving, mind transforms the gift and the gift transforms mind.

"Kind speech" means that when you see sentient beings you arouse the mind of compassion and offer words of loving care. It is contrary to cruel or violent speech.

In the secular world, there is the custom of asking after someone's health. In Buddhism there is the phrase, "Please treasure yourself" and the respectful address to seniors, "May I ask how you are?" It is kind speech to speak to sentient beings as you would to a baby.

Praise those with virtue; pity those without it. If kind speech is offered, little by little virtue will grow. Thus even kind speech which is not ordinarily known or seen comes into being. You should be willing to practice it for this entire present life; do not give up, world after world, life after life. Kind speech is the basis for reconciling rulers and subduing enemies. Those who hear kind speech from you have a delighted expression and a joyful mind. Those who hear of your kind speech will be deeply touched -- they will never forget it.

You should know that kind speech arises from kind mind, and kind mind from the seed of compassionate mind. You should ponder the fact that kind speech is not just praising the merit of others; it has the power to turn the destiny of the nation.

"Beneficial action" is skillfully to benefit all classes of sentient beings, that is, to care about their distant and near future, and to help them by using skillful means. In ancient times, someone helped a caged tortoise; another took care of an injured sparrow. They did not expect a reward; they were moved to do so only for the sake of beneficial action.

Foolish people think that if they help others first, their own benefit will be lost; but this is not so. Beneficial action is an act of oneness, benefiting self and others together. Thus you should benefit friend and enemy equally. You should benefit self and others alike. If you have this mind, even beneficial action for the sake of grasses, trees, wind, and water is spontaneous and unremitting. This being so, make a wholehearted effort to help the ignorant.

"Cooperation" means non-difference. It is non-difference from self, non-difference from others. For example, the Tathagata was born into the human world, and lived a human life. Judging from this identification with the human world you can suppose that he might identify himself with other worlds. When you know cooperation, self and other are of one kind.

"Cooperation" means right form, dignity, correct manner. There is a truth that after self assimilates others to itself, self lets itself be assimilated by others. The relationship of self and others is infinitely varied according to circumstances.

The Guanzi says, "The sea does not refuse water because of its identity with water. You should further understand that water is originally endowed with the virtue of not rejecting the sea. On this account water habitually gathers itself, flowing into the sea, and earth accumulates itself, forming a mountain." My understanding is that because the ocean itself does not reject the ocean, it is the ocean, and it is large. Because mountains do not exclude mountains, they are mountains and they are high.

With a gentle expression, practice cooperation for all people. Each of these four methods of guidance includes all four. Thus, there are sixteen methods of guiding sentient beings.

#show par: it => block(below: 1.4em, it)

There is a reality even prior to heaven and earth; \
Indeed, it has no form, much less a name; \
Eyes fail to see it; it has no voice for ears to detect. \
To call it Mind or Buddha violates its nature \
For it then becomes like a visionary flower in the air.

It is not Mind, nor Buddha; \
Absolutely quiet and yet illuminating in a mysterious way, \
It allows itself to be perceived only by the clear-eyed. \
It is Dharma, truly beyond form and sound; \
It is Dao, having nothing to do with words.

Wishing to entice the blind, \
The Buddha has playfully let words escape his golden mouth; \
Heaven and earth are ever since filled with entangling briars. \
O my good worthy friends gathered here, \
If you desire to listen to the thunderous voice of the Dharma, \
Exhaust your words, ○ empty your thoughts, ○ \
For then you may come to recognize this ○

#sutra-title("Song of Enlightenment", kanji: "證道歌", romaji: "Shōdōka", bells: "○ ●")

#show par: it => block(below: 1.4em, it)

There is the leisurely one, \
walking the Dao, beyond philosophy, \
not avoiding fantasy, not seeking truth. \
The real nature of ignorance is the Buddha-nature itself; \
the empty delusory body is the very body of the Dharma.

When the Dharma body awakens completely, \
there is nothing at all. \
The source of our self-nature \
is the Buddha of innocent truth. \
Mental and physical reactions come and go \
like clouds in the empty sky; \
greed, hatred and ignorance appear and disappear \
like bubbles on the surface of the sea.

When we realize actuality, \
there is no distinction between mind and thing \
and the path to hell instantly vanishes. \
If this is a lie to fool the world, \
my tongue may be cut out forever.

Once we awaken to the Tathagata-Zen, \
the six noble deeds and the ten thousand good actions \
are already complete within us. \
In our dream we see the six levels of illusion clearly; \
After we awaken the whole universe is empty.

No bad fortune, no good fortune, no loss, no gain; \
never seek such things in eternal serenity. \
For years the dusty mirror has gone uncleaned, \
now let us polish it completely, once and for all.

Who has no-thought? Who is not-born? \
If we are truly not-born, we are not un-born either. \
Ask a robot if this is not so.

How can we realize ourselves \
by virtuous deeds or by seeking the Buddha?

Release your hold on earth, water, fire, wind; \
drink and eat as you wish in eternal serenity. \
All things are transient and completely empty; \
this is the great enlightenment of the Tathagata.

Transience, emptiness and enlightenment— \
these are the ultimate truths of Buddhism; \
keeping and teaching them is true Sangha devotion. \
If you don't agree, please ask me about it.

Cut out directly the root of it all: \
this is the very point of the Buddha-seal. \
I can't respond to any concern about leaves and branches.

People do not recognize the Mani-jewel. \
Living intimately within the Tathāgata-garbha, \
it operates our sight, hearing, smell, taste, sensation, awareness; \
and all of these are empty, yet not empty.

The rays shining from this perfect Mani-jewel \
have the form of no form at all. \
Clarify the five eyes and develop the five powers; \
this is not intellectual work—just realize, just know. \
It is not difficult to see images in a mirror, \
but who can take hold of the moon in the water?

Always working alone, always walking alone, \
the enlightened one walks the free way of Nirvāṇa \
with melody that is old and clear in spirit \
and naturally elegant in style, \
but with body that is tough and bony, \
passing unnoticed in the world.

We know that Shakya's sons and daughters \
are poor in body, but not in the Dao. \
In their poverty, they always wear ragged clothing, \
but they have the jewel of no price treasured within.

The jewel of no price can never be used up \
though they spend it freely to help people they meet. \
Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya, \
and the four kinds of wisdom \
are all contained within. \
The eight kinds of emancipation and the six universal powers \
are all impressed on the ground of their mind.

The best student goes directly to the ultimate; \
the others are very learned but their faith is uncertain. \
Remove the dirty garments from your own mind; \
why should you show off your outward striving?

Some may slander, some may abuse; \
they try to set fire to the heavens with a torch \
and end by merely tiring themselves out. \
I hear their scandal as though it were ambrosial truth; \
immediately everything melts \
and I enter the place beyond thought and words.

When I consider the virtue of abusive words, \
I find the scandal-monger is my good teacher. \
If we do not become angry at gossip, \
we have no need for powerful endurance and compassion.

To be mature in Zen is to be mature in expression, \
and full-moon brilliance of dhyana and prajna \
does not stagnate in emptiness. \
Not only can I take hold of complete enlightenment by myself, \
but all Buddha-bodies, like sands of the Ganges, \
can become awakened in exactly the same way.

The incomparable lion-roar of the doctrine \
shatters the brains of the one hundred kinds of animals. \
Even the king of elephants will run away, forgetting his pride; \
only the heavenly dragon listens calmly, with pure delight.

I wandered over rivers and seas, crossing mountains and streams, \
visiting teachers, asking about the Way in personal interviews; \
since I recognized the Sixth Founding Teacher at Caoqi, \
I know what is beyond the relativity of birth and death.

Walking is Zen, sitting is Zen; \
speaking or silent, active or quiet, the essence is at peace. \
Even facing the sword of death, our mind is unmoved; \
even drinking poison, our mind is quiet.

Our teacher, Śākyamuni, met Dipankara Buddha \
and for many eons he trained as Kshanti, the ascetic. \
Many births, many deaths; \
I am serene in this cycle—there is no end to it.

Since I abruptly realized the unborn, \
I have had no reason for joy or sorrow \
at any honor or disgrace. \
I have entered the deep mountains to silence and beauty; \
in a profound valley beneath high cliffs, \
I sit under the old pine trees. \
Zazen in my rustic cottage \
is peaceful, lonely and truly comfortable.

When you truly awaken, \
you have no formal merit. \
In the multiplicity of the relative world, \
you cannot find such freedom. \
Self-centered merit brings the joy of heaven itself, \
but is like shooting an arrow at the sky; \
when the force is exhausted, it falls to the earth, \
and then everything goes wrong.

Why should this be better than the true way of the absolute, \
directly penetrating the ground of Tathagata? \
Just take hold of the source \
and never mind the branches. \
It is like a treasure-moon \
enclosed in a beautiful emerald. \
Now I understand this Mani-jewel \
and my gain is the gain of everyone endlessly.

The moon shines on the river, \
the wind blows through the pines. \
Whose providence is this long beautiful evening? \
The Buddha-nature jewel of morality \
is impressed on the ground of my mind, \
and my robe is the dew, the fog, the cloud and the mist.

A bowl once calmed dragons \
and a staff separated fighting tigers; \
the rings on this staff jingle musically. \
The form of these expressions is not to be taken lightly; \
the treasure-staff of the Tathagata \
has left traces for us to follow.

The awakened one does not seek truth— \
does not cut off delusion. \
Truth and delusion are both vacant and without form, \
but this no-form is neither empty nor not empty; \
it is the truly real form of the Tathagata.

The mind-mirror is clear, so there are no obstacles. \
Its brilliance illuminates the universe \
to the depths and in every grain of sand. \
Multitudinous things of the cosmos \
are all reflected in the mind, \
and this full clarity is beyond inner and outer.

To live in nothingness is to ignore cause and effect; \
this chaos leads only to disaster. \
The one who clings to vacancy, rejecting the world of things, \
escapes from drowning but leaps into the fire.

Holding truth and rejecting delusion— \
these are but skillful lies. \
Students who do zazen by such lies \
love thievery in their own children.

They miss the Dharma-treasure; \
they lose accumulated power; \
and this disaster follows directly upon dualistic thinking. \
So Zen is the complete realization of mind, \
the complete cutting off of delusion, \
the power of wise vision penetrating directly to the unborn.

Students of vigorous will hold the sword of wisdom; \
the prajna edge is a diamond flame. \
It not only cuts off useless knowledge, \
but also exterminates delusions.

They roar with Dharma-thunder; \
they strike the Dharma-drum; \
they spread clouds of love, and pour ambrosial rain. \
Their giant footsteps nourish limitless being; \
Shravaka, Pratyeka, Bodhisattva—all are enlightened; \
five kinds of human nature—all are emancipated.

High in the Himalayas, only fei-ni grass grows. \
Here cows produce pure and delicious milk, \
and this food I continually enjoy. \
One complete nature passes to all natures; \
one universal Dharma encloses all Dharmas.

One moon is reflected in many waters; \
all the water-moons are from the one moon. \
The Dharma-body of all Buddhas has entered my own nature, \
and my nature becomes one with the Tathagata. \
One level completely contains all levels; \
it is not matter, mind, nor activity. \
In an instant eight-thousand teachings are fulfilled; \
in a twinkling the evil of eons is destroyed.

All categories are no category; \
what relation have these to my insight? \
Beyond praise, beyond blame \
like space itself it has no bounds.

Right here it is eternally full and serene, \
if you search elsewhere, you cannot see it. \
You cannot grasp it, you cannot reject it; \
in the midst of not gaining, \
in that condition you gain it.

It speaks in silence, \
in speech you hear its silence. \
The great way has opened and there are no obstacles. \
If someone asks, "what is your sect \
and how do you understand it?" \
I reply, "the power of tremendous prajna."

People say it is positive; \
people say it is negative; \
but they do not know. \
A smooth road, a rough road— \
even heaven cannot imagine. \
I have continued my zazen for many eons; \
I do not say this to confuse you.

I raise the Dharma-banner and set fourth our teaching; \
it is the clear doctrine of the Buddha \
which I found with my teacher, Huineng. \
Mahakasyapa became the Buddha successor, \
received the lamp and passed it on.

Twenty-eight generations of teachers in India, \
then over seas and rivers to our land \
Bodhidharma came as our own first founder, \
and his robe, as we all know, pass through six teachers here. \
And how many generations to come may gain the path, \
no one knows.

The truth is not set forth; \
the false is basically vacant. \
Put both existence and non-existence aside; \
then even non-vacancy is vacant. \
The twenty kinds of vacancy have no basis, \
and the oneness of the Tathagata-being \
is naturally sameness.

Mind is the base, phenomena are dust; \
yet both are like a flaw in the mirror. \
When the flaw is brushed aside, \
the light begins to shine. \
When both mind and phenomena are forgotten, \
then we become naturally genuine.

Ah, the degenerate materialistic world! \
People are unhappy; they find self-control difficult. \
In the centuries since Śākyamuni, false views are deep, \
demons are strong, the Dharma is weak, disturbances are many.

People hear the Buddha's doctrine of immediacy, \
and if they accept it, the demons will be crushed \
as easily as a roofing tile. \
But they cannot accept. What a pity!

Your mind is the source of action; \
your body is the agent of calamity; \
no pity nor blame to anyone else. \
If you don't seek an invitation to hell, \
never slander the Tathagata's true teaching.

In the sandalwood forest, there is no other tree. \
Only the lion lives in such deep luxurant woods, \
wandering freely in a state of peace. \
Other animals and birds stay far away.

Just baby lions follow the parent, \
and three-year-olds already roar loudly. \
How can the jackal pursue the king of the Dharma \
even with a hundred-thousand demonic arts?

The Buddha's doctrine of directness \
is not a matter for human emotion. \
If you doubt this or feel uncertain, \
then you must discuss it with me. \
This is not the free rein of a mountain monk's ego. \
I fear your training may lead to wrong views \
of permanent soul or complete extinction.

Being is not being; non-being is not non-being; \
miss this rule by a hair, \
and you are off by a thousand miles. \
Understanding it, the dragon-child abruptly attains Buddhahood; \
misunderstanding it, the greatest scholar falls into hell.

From my youth I piled studies upon studies, \
in sutras and shastras I searched and researched, \
classifying terms and form, oblivious to fatigue. \
I entered the sea to count the sands in vain \
and then the Tathagata scolded me kindly \
as I read "What profit in counting your neighbor's treasure?" \
My work had been scattered and entirely useless, \
for years I was dust blown by the wind.

If the seed-nature is wrong, misunderstandings arise, \
and the Buddha's doctrine of immediacy cannot be attained. \
Shravaka and Pratyeka students may study earnestly \
but they lack aspiration. \
Others may be very clever, \
but they lack prajna.

Stupid ones, childish ones, \
they suppose there is something in an empty fist. \
They mistake the pointing finder for the moon. \
They are idle dreamers lost in form and sensation.

Not supposing something is the Tathagata, \
this is truly called Guanyin, the Bodhisattva who sees freely. \
When awakened we find karmic hindrances fundamentally empty \
but when not awakened, we must repay all our debts.

The hungry are served a king's repast; \
and they cannot eat. \
The sick meet the king of doctors; \
why don't they recover? \
The practice of Zen in this greedy world— \
this is the power of wise vision. \
The lotus lives in the midst of the fire; \
it is never destroyed.

Pradhanashura broke the gravest precepts; \
but he went on to realize the unborn. \
The Buddhahood he attained in that moment \
lives with us now in our time.

The incomparable lion roar of the doctrine! \
How sad that people are stubbornly ignorant, \
just knowing that crime blocks enlightenment, \
not seeing the secret of the Tathagata teaching.

Two monks were guilty of murder and carnality. \
Their leader, Upali, had the light of a glow-worm; \
he just added to their guilt. \
Vimalakirti cleared their doubts at once \
as sunshine melts the frost and snow.

The remarkable power of emancipation \
works wonders innumerable as the sands of the Ganges. \
To this we offer clothing, food, bedding, medicine. \
Ten thousand pieces of gold are not sufficient; \
though you break your body \
and your bones become powder, \
this is not enough for repayment. \
One vivid word surpasses millions of years of practice.

The King of the Dharma deserves our highest respect. \
Tathagatas, innumerable as sands of the Ganges, \
all prove this fact by their attainment. \
Now I know what the Mani-jewel is: \
those who believe this will gain it accordingly.

When we see truly, there is nothing at all. \
There is no person; there is no Buddha. \
Innumerable things of the universe \
are just bubbles on the sea. \
Wise sages are all like flashes of lightning.

However the burning iron ring revolves about my head, \
with bright completeness of dhyana and prajna, \
I never lose my equanimity . \
If the sun becomes cold, and the moon hot, \
evil cannot shatter the truth. \
The carriage of the elephant moves like a mountain, \
how can the mantis block the road?

The great elephant does not loiter on the rabbit's path. \
Great enlightenment is not concerned with details. \
Don't belittle the sky by looking through a pipe. \
If you still don't understand, I will settle it for you. ○

The mind of the great sage of India \
was intimately conveyed from west to east. \
Though people may be sharp-witted or dull, \
there's no north and south in the Way.

The deep spring sparkles in the pure light, \
its branches streaming through the darkness. \
Grasping at phenomena is the source of delusion; \
uniting with the absolute falls short of awakening.

All of the senses, all the things sensed, \
they interact without interaction. \
Interacting, they permeate one another, \
yet each remains in its own place.

By nature, forms differ in shape and appearance. \
By nature, sounds bring pleasure or pain. \
In darkness, the fine and mediocre accord; \
brightness makes clear and murky distinct.

Each element comes back to its own nature \
just as a child finds its own mother. \
Fire is hot, the wind blows, water is wet and earth solid, \
eyes see forms, ears hear sounds, noses smell, \
tongues tell salty from sour—so it is with everything everywhere.

The root puts forth each separate shoot. \
Both root and shoot go back to the fundamental fact. \
Exalted and lowly is just a matter of words. \
In the very midst of light, there is darkness; \
don't meet another in darkness.

In the very midst of darkness, there is light; \
don't observe another in the light. \
Light and darkness complement each other \
like the foot before and the foot behind in walking, \
Each of the myriad things has its particular virtue \
inevitably expressed in its use and station.

Phenomena accord with the fundamental as a lid fits a box; \
the fundamental meets phenomena like arrows in mid-air. \
Hearing these words, understand the fundamental; \
don't cook up principles from your own ideas.

If you overlook the Way right before your eyes, \
how will you know the path beneath your feet? \
Advancing has nothing to do with near and far, \
yet delusion creates obstacles high and wide. \
Students of the mystery, ○ I humbly urge you, \
don't waste ○ a moment, night or day! ○

I built a grass hut where there's nothing of value. \
After eating, I relax and enjoy a nap. \
When it was completed, fresh weeds appeared. \
Now it's been lived in—covered by weeds.

The person in the hut lives here calmly, \
not stuck to inside, outside, or in between. \
Places worldly people live, s/he doesn't live. \
Realms worldly people love, s/he doesn't love.

Though the hut is small, it includes the entire world. \
In ten feet square, an old one illumines forms and their nature. \
A Great Vehicle bodhisattva trusts without doubt. \
The middling or lowly can't help wondering: \
Will this hut perish or not?

Perishable or not, the original master is present, \
not dwelling south or north, east or west. \
Firmly based on steadiness, it can't be surpassed. \
A shining window below the green pines— \
jade palaces or vermilion towers can't compare with it.

Just sitting with head covered all things are at rest. \
Thus, this mountain monk doesn't understand at all. \
Living here s/he no longer works to get free. \
Who would proudly arrange seats, trying to entice guests?

Turn around the light to shine within, then just return. \
The vast inconceivable source can't be faced or turned away from. \
Meet the ancestral teachers, be familiar with their instruction, \
bind grasses to build a hut, and don't give up.

Let go of hundreds of years and relax completely. \
Open your hands and walk, innocent. \
Thousands of words, myriad interpretations, \
are only to free you from obstructions. ○

If you want to know the undying person in the hut, ○ \
don't separate from this skin bag here and now. ○

#sutra-title("Verse of the Faith-Mind", kanji: "信心銘", romaji: "Shinjinmei / Xinxin Ming", bells: "○ ●")

#show par: it => block(below: 1.4em, it)

The supreme way is not difficult \
if only you do not choose. \
When there is neither love nor hate, \
all is open and clear.

If there is the slightest distinction, \
it is the distance between heaven and earth. \
If you wish to see it revealed, \
let go of preference and aversion.

The conflict between like and dislike \
is a disease of the mind. \
When this deep truth is not understood, \
you try to still your thoughts in vain.

The way is perfect, like vast space, \
with nothing lacking and nothing in excess. \
It is only because you accept and reject \
that its Suchness is lost.

Neither chase after outer appearances \
nor stay in the awareness of the void: \
simply be serene in the One \
and confusion will disappear by itself.

When you stop activity to return to stillness, \
the stopping itself is just more activity. \
Remaining in duality, \
how will you ever know the One?

Unless you penetrate the One, \
you cannot function in either realm. \
To reject existence is to lose existence; \
to follow the void is to go against the void.

The more words and thoughts, \
the less they fit the reality. \
Cut off words, cut off thoughts, \
and there is no place it does not penetrate.

Return to the root and you gain the truth, \
follow appearances and you lose the essence. \
Even an instant of interior illumination \
goes beyond the first void; \
changes in this relative void \
are due entirely to delusion.

No need to search for the truth: \
just let go of all your opinions, \
not abiding in dualistic views, \
careful not to pursue them.

For if there is a bit of right and wrong, \
the mind is lost in confusion. \
There are two because there is one, \
but do not then cling to the one.

When the one mind does not arise, \
the ten thousand things have no blame. \
When there is no blame, there is no thing; \
when it does not arise, there is no mind.

Subject vanishes along with object; \
object vanished along with subject. \
Object is object because there is subject; \
subject is subject because there is object.

If you want to know both levels— \
they are originally one void. \
The one void is the same in both \
and they equally contain all things.

When you do not distinguish between fine and coarse, \
how can there be any bias? \
The Great Way is in essence broad, \
neither easy nor difficult.

To hold narrow views causes apprehension; \
the more you hurry, the longer it takes. \
If you cling to such views, \
the right measure is lost, \
and you are sure to go astray.

Let go of them and everything is natural; \
in essence there is neither going nor staying. \
Just act according to your nature, \
and you will accord ○ with the Way, \
walking it leisurely, ○ free from care. ○

Discursive thought turns away from the truth; \
a dull, murky mind won't do either. \
Feeling dislike, the spirit is troubled; \
what use is there in being for or against things?

If you want to take the one vehicle, \
have no aversion to the world of the senses. \
Indeed, not hating the sense ○ world \
is identical ○ with true enlightenment.

The wise have no goals, \
the ignorant shackle themselves: \
for although among things there are no differences, \
they vainly form attachments.

Using the mind to seek the mind— \
isn't that a great mistake? \
Rest and unrest arise in delusion, \
enlightenment knows neither like nor dislike.

All dualistic views come \
from your own mistaken deductions. \
They are dreams, fantasies, spots before your eyes; \
why do you try to grasp them?

Gain and loss, right and wrong— \
let go of them once and for all! \
If the eyes never sleep, \
dreams naturally cease;

If the mind does not distinguish, \
everything is One Suchness. \
The essence of One Suchness is a mystery: \
unmoving, absolute, karmic relations forgotten.

When you see all things equally, \
they return to their natural state: \
causation disappears and comparisons cannot be made. \
Stop moving and there is no movement;

Put rest in motion and there is no rest. \
Since the two do not exist, \
how can there be one? \
In the absolute there are no rules;

The mind that accords with it becomes impartial, \
ceasing to plan and strive. \
When doubts and suspicion are cleared away \
true faith is easily attained.

All things are transitory; \
there is no need to remember them. \
Void, clear, self-illuminating— \
the mind does not make efforts.

This is the place of no-thinking, \
difficult to fathom with intellect or feeling. \
In the dharma world of Suchness, \
there is no other, there is no self.

When you are asked to express it immediately, \
you can only say, "Not two!" \
If not-two, then everything is the same; \
there is nothing that is not included.

The wise of the ten directions \
have all entered this truth; \
it is beyond expansion and contraction; \
one moment of awareness is ten thousand years.

Neither being nor non-being, \
the entire universe is before your eyes. \
The infinitely small is the same as the large; \
boundaries have vanished.

The infinitely large is the same as the small; \
divisions cannot be seen. \
Being is nothing but non-being; \
non-being is nothing but being.

When it is not yet like this for you, \
by no means remain in that state. \
One is all, all is one. \
If you realize it thus, \
why worry about not finishing?

The faith-mind is not-two; \
not-two is the faith-mind. \
Words fail to express ○ it. \
It is not of the ○ past, future, or present. ○

#sutra-title("Discourse on Love", kanji: "慈經", romaji: "Metta Sutta", bells: "○ ●")

Those who want to attain peace should practice being upright, humble, and capable of using loving speech. They will know how to live simply and happily, with senses calmed, without being covetous and carried away by the emotions of the majority. Let them not do anything that will be disapproved of by the wise ones.

#under-title-note[(And this is what they contemplate:)]

"May everyone be happy and safe, and may their hearts be filled with joy. \

"May all living beings live in security and in peace: beings who are frail or strong, tall or short, big or small, visible or not visible, near or far away, already born or yet to be born. May all of them dwell in perfect tranquility. \

"Let no one do harm to anyone. Let no one put the life of anyone in danger. Let no one, out of anger or ill will, wish anyone any harm. \

"Just as parents love and protect their children at the risk of their own lives, we should cultivate boundless love to offer to all living beings in the entire cosmos. We should let our boundless love pervade the whole universe, above, below and across. \

"Our love will know no obstacles, our heart will be absolutely free from hatred and enmity. Whether standing or walking, sitting or lying, as long as we are awake, we should maintain this mindfulness of love in our own hearts. This is the noblest way of living." \

#sutra-title("Discourse on Happiness", kanji: "吉祥經", romaji: "Mahāmangala Sutta", bells: "○ ●")

I heard these words of the Buddha one time when the Lord was living in the vicinity of Shravasti at the Anathapindika monastery in the Jeta Park. Late at night a deva appeared whose light and beauty made the whole Jeta Grove shine radiantly. After paying respects to the Buddha, the deva asked him a question in the form of a verse:

"Many gods and men are eager to know \
what are the greatest blessings \
which can bring about a peaceful and happy life. \
Please, Tathagata, will you teach us?"

#under-title-note[(This is the Buddha's answer:)]

"Not to be associated with the foolish ones, \
to live in the company of wise people \
and to honor those who are worth honoring— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To live in a good environment, \
to have planted good seeds \
and to realize that you are on the right path— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To have a chance to learn, \
and to be skillful in your profession or craft \
and to know how to practice the precepts and loving speech— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To be able to support your parents, \
to cherish your own family \
and to have a job that you like— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To live correctly, to be generous in giving, \
to be able to give support to relatives and friends \
and to live a life of blameless conduct— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To avoid doing bad things, \
to avoid being caught by alcoholism or drugs \
and to be diligent in doing good things— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To be humble and polite, \
to be grateful and content with a simple life \
and not to miss the occasion to learn the dharma— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To persevere and be open to change, \
to have regular contact with monks and nuns \
and to participate in dharma discussions— \
this is the greatest happiness.

"To live diligently and attentively, \

this is the greatest happiness.

"To live in the world, \

== Transmission of the Precepts

#speaker([All])
#indented-block[
The Great Precepts of all the Buddhas have been maintained and protected by all the Buddhas. Buddhas hand them down to Buddhas, and Ancestral Teachers hand them down to Ancestral Teachers. Acceptance and observance of the Precepts transcends past, present, and future, and form the perfect accord in realization between teacher and disciple, continuing through all ages.

Our great teacher, Shakyamuni Buddha, imparted them to Mahakashyapa and Mahakashyapa transmitted them to Ananda. Already the Precepts have passed through many generations in direct succession, reaching down to the present head of this temple.

Now, receiving the Great Precepts, I vow to requite my deep obligation to the Buddhas and Ancestral Teachers. I pledge to establish these Precepts as essential teachings for human beings and other beings so that all will inherit the wisdom of the Buddha.

== Verse of the Rakusu

Vast is the robe of liberation! \
It is the formless field of virtue. \
Wearing it, I embody the Tathagata's teaching, \
to liberate all beings.
